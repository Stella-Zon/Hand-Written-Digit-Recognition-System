MNIST Digit Classification with Various Models

This project compares the performance of different machine learning models on the MNIST dataset, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and a Neural Network (NN) built with Keras. The best-performing model is then tested with an unseen image uploaded by the user.

Project Overview

The project aims to explore and compare the performance of different machine learning models on the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, and their performance is visualized using line graphs and confusion matrices. Finally, the best model is used to predict the digit from an uploaded image.

Models Used:

  1.Logistic Regression

  2.Support Vector Machine (SVM)

  3.k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

  4.Neural Network (NN) with Keras

Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used for training and evaluating the models. It consists of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) with corresponding labels.
